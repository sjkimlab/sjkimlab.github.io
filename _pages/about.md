We are a new, interdisciplinary lab in <a href='https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/sangjin' target='_blank'>the Department of Physics at UIUC</a>. We are interested in physical principles underlying molecular interactions and functions inside the cell. Currently, our focus is how gene expression machines work together in the cellular context.

We are hiring! We are looking for highly energetic and motivated graduate students and postdocs with background in physics, chemistry, or biology. Please contact Sangjin via email.

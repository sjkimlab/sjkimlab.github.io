We are a Biological Physics lab in <a href='https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/sangjin' target='_blank'>the Department of Physics at UIUC</a>. We study physical principles underlying molecular interactions and functions inside cells. Currently, our focus is how gene expression machines work together in the cellular context. We develop new methodologies based on molecular, optical, and computational approaches and ask critical molecule-level questions that matter for living cells.

<br>
We are hiring! We are looking for highly energetic and motivated graduate students and postdocs with a background in physics, chemistry, or biology.
See the <a href="/joining">joining the lab</a> page for detail.
